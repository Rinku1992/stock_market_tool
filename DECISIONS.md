- **LangGraph for the orchestrator only.** It gives parallel runs, retries, timeouts and
  resume, so we do not write that glue. Analysts stay plain functions so they are easy to
  test and we are not locked in.
- **Fixed graph, no free-roaming agents.** Repeatable output is the reliability benchmark.
- **Own thin Claude wrapper, no LangChain chains.** Prompts stay visible, every call is
  recorded, and a second LLM can be added later for cross-checks.
- **DuckDB first, BigQuery later.** Free and fast on a laptop. SQL carries over.
- **Point-in-time feature store from day one.** Each feature stores when it became known.
  Without this, backtests leak the future.
- **`origin` tag on every feature (code or llm).** LLM features on dates before the model
  cutoff can leak the future, so backtests must be able to exclude them.
- **Report schema rejects directional views without evidence, and evidence dated after
  `as_of`.** The rule is enforced in code, not left to prompts.
- **Data grade C stops the run.** No verdict on bad data.
- **Defaults:** free data sources, laptop, Nifty 100.
